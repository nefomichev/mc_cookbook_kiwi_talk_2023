    "Today we're gonna speak about an ultimate validation framework that takes only several lines of code to implement but can solve most of doubts and questions during your AB career:\n",

    "> Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess many of you are familiar with this method but do not use it as often as we should.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me try to convince you that a nice Monte Carlo framework deployed into your workflow is better than a new trendy habit of outsourcing our reasoning and validations by simply asking ChatGPT. \n",

    "**Disclaimer**\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is not scientific research by any means, I won't introduce a complex theory or innovative method of solving the problems instead the article is a **cookbook** to guide you through the main use cases when the MC is an **essential tool for validating your ideas and other methodologies*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before defining Monte-Carlo as a tool, let's take a step back and briefly discuss the statistics concept behind the AB testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Bayesian AB methods are gaining popularity nowadays, the frequentist approach remains the king of the hill. So, I assume most of you use a frequent-based interpretation and corresponding methodologies for estimating the experimentation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Frequentist statistics is the traditional framework for making sense of data and uncertainty **through the long-run frequency**. When we apply this to A/B testing, we are engaging with a world where probability is tied to the **idea of repeatable**, long-term patterns rather than beliefs or subjective chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability as Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "In the frequentist viewpoint, **probability** is defined as the limit of the expected **frequency of an event over many, many trials**. For example, when we say there's a 50% chance of flipping heads on a coin, we mean that if we could flip the coin an infinite number of times, about half of those flips would come up heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inference Through Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run an A/B test, you're essentially conducting a hypothesis test. You have a null hypothesis (H0) that there is no difference between A and B, and an alternative hypothesis (H1) that there is a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequentist inference uses data from your samples to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the p-value comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's calculated from your data and represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The probability** of observing results as extreme as you did, or more so, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this probability is low, it suggests that such an extreme result is unlikely to have occurred by random chance alone, leading us to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Intervals and Estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A 95% CI means that if **we could repeat our experiment over and over again**, 95% of the time the interval would capture the true parameter we're estimating. It's a range derived from the sample data that conveys where the true value lies with a certain level of confidence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, if the modern CPUs are so good in computations compared to the age of discovering a T-test ... . Can we just repeatedly simulate things over and over to make a bulletproof validation? Yes! This is exactly, what a Monte-Carlo is in a nutshell!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulations can be used within the frequentist paradigm to understand the behavior of statistics under **repeated sampling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo allows us to perform \"virtual experiments\" by simulating the process of data collection and analysis many times over, which helps in understanding the distribution of our test statistic under the null hypothesis or in evaluating the properties of our confidence intervals.\n",

    "Monte Carlo is rooted deeply in the frequentist logic. It gives us a robust method for validating almost anything we may need during the AB research work:\n",

    "- Performing power analysis for different treatment effects\n",
    "- Testing new techniques and tricks\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, in practice, we can resolve almost any doubts about our methodologies and math just by performing the right Monte Carlo simulation. As well as educating ourselves by studying the MC results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# That's it?\n",
    "\n",
    "I understand that most of you are already experienced AB scientists and Monte-Carlo is not a rocket science to present.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, my goal is to remind you how powerful the technique actually is. To do that, let's go through some interesting examples, when MC can save you from making mistakes in your AB analysis and debunk some rusty AB myths along the road.\n",
